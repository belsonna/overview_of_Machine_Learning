# overview_of_Machine_Learning
If you start in the machine learning field, this rep is for you. I present in this repo the notebook templates and my proposals for solutions to these notebooks. These templates were proposed by Marc Deisenroth during our Foundations to Machine Learning course at AMMI (African Master in Machine Intelligence). I am open to discuss it if you do not understand certain points. Together we can do better.  Enjoy
### Contents

#### In this Repo you will find:
#### Linear Algebra and PCA
#### Linear Regression
#### Logistic Regression
